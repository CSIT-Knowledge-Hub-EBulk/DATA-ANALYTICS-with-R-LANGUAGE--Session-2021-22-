Data Preprocessing in R

Topics: Machine Learning

Data preprocessing is the initial phase of Machine Learning where data is prepared for machine learning models. This part is crucial and needs to be performed properly and systematically. If not, we will end up building models that are not accurate for their purpose.
We will learn all the steps that are involved in the data preprocessing stage.
